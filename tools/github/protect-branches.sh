# Makes GitHub enforce the branch rules in AGENTS.md, for everyone,
# administrators included:
#
# - dev, acceptance and main can be neither force-pushed nor deleted;
# - dev takes pull requests only, once their ci checks passed, and one
#   that changes the decisions or the plan only with the owner's approval
#   (.github/CODEOWNERS). The owner, an administrator, may still push to
#   it, as promotions and fixes need;
# - acceptance takes only commits whose ci checks passed;
# - main takes only commits whose ci and acceptance checks passed.
#
# Promotions are fast-forwards of commits already tested on the branch
# before, so they pass; a commit made on the branch itself, such as a pull
# request's merge commit, has no checks yet and is refused.
#
# Run it once as a repository administrator, with the GitHub CLI signed in:
#
#   tools/github/protect-branches.sh [owner/repo]
#
# Running it again reapplies the same rules. Check names are the jobs of
# .github/workflows/ci.yml and acceptance.yml; update both lists when a job
# is renamed or added.
