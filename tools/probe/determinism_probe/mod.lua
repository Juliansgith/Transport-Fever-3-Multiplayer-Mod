-- tools/probe/determinism_probe/mod.lua
--
-- A read-only Transport Fever game-script mod that hashes the simulation lanes
-- from docs/DAY_ONE.md section 4 every N simulation steps and appends one line
-- per sample to a log. Run two instances from the same save with no input; feed
-- the two logs to tools/probe/compare_runs.py to find the first step at which a
-- lane diverges. This is the D2 determinism calibration.
--
-- Written against the TPF2 script API (best guess for TPF3). Every lane is in a
-- pcall and logs "err" rather than crashing, so a missing API narrows the probe
-- instead of stopping it. No globals are created; nothing is written to the world.
--
-- ASSUMPTION (TPF2, re-checked on TPF3): Script Mod folder = mod.lua +
-- res/config/game_script/<name>.lua; update() runs in the authoritative engine
-- state once per simulation step.
-- TF3 (investigation/TF3_MODS_2026-09-27.md): mods made for build 40391 use
-- mod.json, _content.json and content/, and run per-frame code as GUI react
-- plugins (react.onStep); none uses a game script. This probe must be ported
-- before it can load in TF3 (docs/PLAN.md, Part 1).
