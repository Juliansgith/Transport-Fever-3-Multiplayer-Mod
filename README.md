# TPF3-MP

Multiplayer for Transport Fever 3, with dedicated servers. Players on Windows,
Linux and macOS can share one room.

Transport Fever 3 releases on 2026-09-29 and is single-player only. This
project adds multiplayer from outside the game. Until release, only the
network side can be built and tested; everything that touches the game
waits for the [release-day investigation](docs/DAY_ONE.md).

## How it works

- **The server owns the truth.** A dedicated server orders every player
  action and advances a deterministic canonical state machine: companies,
  money, ownership, lines, vehicles, economy.
- **Each player's game is a replica.** It applies the same ordered events at
  the same simulation step and reports back. The server checks the reports
  and rebases a replica that drifts.
- **Mixed platforms work.** The design never depends on different game builds
  simulating identically.

The full design is in [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md), the
reasoning behind it in [docs/DECISIONS.md](docs/DECISIONS.md), and what a
build has to carry to replay on another machine in
[docs/BUILDING.md](docs/BUILDING.md); what a large world costs to load,
hold and save is in [docs/BIGMAPS.md](docs/BIGMAPS.md). Players start
with [docs/PLAYING.md](docs/PLAYING.md); server operators with
[docs/OPERATIONS.md](docs/OPERATIONS.md).

## Status

**Milestone M1: the core netcode, tested without the game.**

- **Protocol.** QUIC with TLS 1.3, per-install Ed25519 identities proven
  against the TLS session, and a version preamble frozen for good. Where a
  network blocks UDP, the same QUIC connection runs through a WebSocket on
  port 443; clients fall back to it on their own.
- **Rooms.** HMAC-tagged invites and optional passwords, a lobby with
  readiness and content fingerprints, owner hand-over.
- **Sequencer.** Hard lockstep turns. A server-owned clock holds for players
  who are loading or slow, and stops waiting for one that stalls. Pause,
  speed, and exact resume after a reconnect, which survives a server restart.
  Long games' logs are compacted to the canonical state plus the last hour
  of turns, so a restart replays little and no log outgrows its disk.
- **Playout.** Each client plays behind its own jitter buffer, so a player
  feels their own round trip plus a small buffer. Paced bots over 150 ms
  round trips see a median of about 220 ms, and a poor link delays only its
  owner.
- **Protection.** Four adversarial security reviews (the server, snapshot
  transfer, tunnels and log compaction, and the player's side) found no
  critical issue. Every finding is fixed and guarded by a test:
  - per-address limits on sessions, handshakes, rooms and tunnels;
  - QUIC retries under load;
  - budgets for turns, payload bytes, logs and uploads;
  - crash recovery that never damages a log or resumes a client onto
    turns it did not see;
  - checkpoint verdicts one member cannot switch off;
  - bounded memory for a client whose server or game misbehaves;
  - decoders fuzzed with corrupted messages of every kind a peer sends.
- **Economy.** TPF2MP's economy core ported to integer arithmetic. All
  46,048 of TPF2MP's parity vectors replay identically against the original
  Lua.
- **Snapshots.** A deduplicating chunk store for world saves: 100 scattered
  edits to a 120 MiB save transfer 8.9 MiB. Rooms save together, agree on a
  save by its lane digests, and hand it to players who join a running game,
  return too late to resume, or diverge. The saved world survives a server
  restart.
- **Game bridge.** The agent drives the game through a step gate on the
  shared-memory link: events between exactly the right steps, steps on the
  jitter-buffered schedule, saves and loads on the room's word, and a rejoin
  after a lost server that the game sees only as a pause.
- **Hook engine.** Signature resolution with per-build profiles, an x86-64
  detour engine, a shared-memory link to the agent, and a proxy-DLL
  generator. All five known TPF2 targets resolve uniquely.
- **Test kit.** A toy game whose canonical rules run on the server, bots
  that play it through the real client, a fake hook that plays it through
  the real bridge, a lossy-network emulator and a load tester. 8 bots over
  a 150 ms, 2%-loss link agree on every lane, and 400 bots in 50 rooms run
  without a divergence. Fake games join running rooms, get rebased after a
  drift and ride out a server restart, and end in the same world.
- **Launcher.** `tpf3mp-agent launcher` opens a page in the player's
  browser to connect, create or join a room, get ready, start, chat, and
  follow the game: fetching the world, loading, playing. It works the same
  on Windows, Linux and macOS, serves the loopback interface only, and
  answers only the page that holds its secret token.
- **Operations.** Prometheus metrics with alerting rules, a hardened
  container image, a deployment runbook, and measured capacity: a busy room
  costs the server about a three-hundredth of a core. CI builds the release
  packages on all three platforms.
- **Players.** A guide to playing, in [docs/PLAYING.md](docs/PLAYING.md).

**Waiting for the game:** the TPF3-specific hook (build profile, detours,
the real `Game`), the check of received saves, the server's rules for
TPF3's commands, and the release-day measurements in
[docs/DAY_ONE.md](docs/DAY_ONE.md). HOOKS.md lists what remains.

## Development

How changes move from a feature branch through `dev` and `acceptance` to
`main`, where releases are drafted, is in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md). Read it
before contributing.

Requires Rust. The toolchain is pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml` and installed
automatically by rustup.

```sh
cargo test --workspace
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

Run a local server with a throwaway certificate, then connect to it:

```sh
cargo run -p tpf3mp-server -- --dev-self-signed runtime/dev-cert.der
cargo run -p tpf3mp-agent -- connect 127.0.0.1:29470 --pin-cert runtime/dev-cert.der
```

In production, the server takes a real certificate (`--cert`, `--key`), and
agents verify it against the public certificate authorities. See
[docs/OPERATIONS.md](docs/OPERATIONS.md) for deployment.

Or use the launcher, which opens a page in your browser:

```sh
cargo run -p tpf3mp-agent -- launcher --server 127.0.0.1:29470 --pin-cert runtime/dev-cert.der --name ann
```

Try a room by hand with two agents:

```sh
cargo run -p tpf3mp-agent -- host 127.0.0.1:29470 --pin-cert runtime/dev-cert.der --name ann
cargo run -p tpf3mp-agent -- join 127.0.0.1:29470 <invite> --pin-cert runtime/dev-cert.der --name bob
```

Play a room through the whole stack, with a fake game in place of TPF3.
Each game process attaches to its agent over shared memory and runs the toy
game behind the step gate, as the real hook will:

```sh
cargo run -p tpf3mp-agent -- host 127.0.0.1:29470 --pin-cert runtime/dev-cert.der --name ann --game-link ann --start-with 2
cargo run -p tpf3mp-testkit --bin tpf3mp-fakegame -- ann --steps 100
cargo run -p tpf3mp-agent -- join 127.0.0.1:29470 <invite> --pin-cert runtime/dev-cert.der --name bob --game-link bob
cargo run -p tpf3mp-testkit --bin tpf3mp-fakegame -- bob --steps 100
```

Both games print the same lane digests at the end. A server with
`--data-dir` keeps world snapshots, so a third game can join the running
room (`join ... --game-link cat`); its game loads the room's world first.

Load-test a server with bots:

```sh
cargo run --release -p tpf3mp-testkit --bin tpf3mp-loadtest -- --rooms 50 --bots 8
```
