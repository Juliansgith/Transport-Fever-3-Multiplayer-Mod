# TPF3-MP: Transport Fever 3 Multiplayer

Play Transport Fever 3 together. Build railways, run lines and grow cities
with your friends in one world, each with your own company or sharing one.

> for supported actions and remaining playtest checks.

## What you get

- **Rooms with a six-character invite.** Create a room, send your friends
  its code (such as `K7QM2X`), and they are in. Add a password if you like.
- **No hosting, no port forwarding.** Games are held together by the
  project's server, so nobody has to leave their PC on for the others,
  and nobody sees anyone else's IP address.
- **Join a game that is already running.** Late players, and players who
  come back after a crash, receive the room's world and catch up.
- **Your choice of rules.** Play with the game's own economy, just as in
  single player, or with rules the server keeps, where nobody can cheat
  money into their company.
- **Chat, and a clear view of the room**: who is in, who is ready, and
  exactly which mods to add or remove when yours differ from the room's.
- **A launcher that looks after itself.** On Windows one EXE installs the
  launcher and multiplayer mod. It downloads only releases the project
  signed and keeps the installed mod updated with the launcher.

## What you need

- **Transport Fever 3** on Steam, and Steam running.
- **Windows 10 or 11** (64-bit). Linux follows after the first release,
  then macOS.
- Everyone in a room needs the same game version and the same mods; the
  launcher tells you what to change.

## Getting started

1. **Download [TPF3-MP.exe](https://github.com/Juliansgith/Transport-Fever-3-Multiplayer-Mod/releases/latest/download/TPF3-MP.exe)**
   and open it. No ZIP extraction or administrator rights are needed.
   Windows may warn about an unknown app: choose **More info**, then **Run anyway**.
2. **Click Install TPF3-MP.** Setup finds Steam's mods folder (choose your
   account if there are several), downloads the signed package, and adds
   Start menu and desktop shortcuts. Start the game through Steam once first if its
   user folder does not exist yet.
3. **Open the launcher and start Transport Fever 3.**
4. **Click Join a friend** to enter your name and invite code, or
   **Multiplayer** to browse public rooms or host your own.
5. **Host a new world or use a save.** New worlds use the game's normal
   setup screens, with TPF3-MP selected automatically, and start multiplayer
   when setup finishes. Keep TPF3-MP active in the world's **Mods** tab.
   Send friends the room's invite code; they join and load the shared world.

Only a game the launcher starts joins the room; started from Steam,
Transport Fever 3 is the plain game, with nothing of TPF3-MP in it.

The full player's guide, with what to do when something does not work,
is in [docs/PLAYING.md](docs/PLAYING.md).

The ZIP remains available for portable/manual installation. Windows
Settings → Apps, or the launcher's Settings, can uninstall a managed
installation; saves and settings are kept. **Repair installation** restores
the package and mod if files are missing or damaged.

## Getting help

- The launcher shows your **support code** at the bottom. Quote it when you
  ask for help: it lets the server's operator find what went wrong for
  you, and it lets nobody into your room, so it is safe to post.
- Report problems in the
  [issues](https://github.com/Juliansgith/Transport-Fever-3-Multiplayer-Mod/issues).
- While you are connected, the launcher sends its log to the server, with
  your paths, codes and addresses taken out, so there are no files to
  send. You can turn this off in **Settings**.

## Credits
