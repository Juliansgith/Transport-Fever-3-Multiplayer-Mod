//! World snapshots on the server: the chunk store, a running game's saves,
//! which save its room agrees on, and where that save stands in the log.
//! The room drives them (see `room.rs`); "Snapshots" in `docs/PROTOCOL.md`
//! describes the flow.
//!
//! A save starts as a `Save` event sealed alone at the end of its turn.
//! Every client that plays through it saves its world and reports the
//! world's lanes and the snapshot it made. Once the players pacing the room
//! have reported, or the deadline passes, the room judges the lanes like a
//! checkpoint's. A player whose lanes agree uploads its snapshot. That
//! snapshot is then what players who need a world receive.
