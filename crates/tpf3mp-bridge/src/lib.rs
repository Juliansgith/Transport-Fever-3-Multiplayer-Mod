//! What the agent and the in-game hook say to each other over the
//! shared-memory link (`tpf3mp-ipc`), and the step gate that keeps the
//! game's simulation in step with the room.
//!
//! The agent runs the network side: it follows the room's turn stream and
//! decides when each step may run (`tpf3mp_agent::Playout`). The hook runs
//! inside the game and does as little as it can. It applies events and runs
//! steps when the [`Gate`] allows, and reports what the player does and how
//! far the game has got.
//!
//! # Ordering
//!
//! Each direction is an ordered stream of messages. The agent sends every
//! event for step `s` after releasing step `s - 1` and before releasing step
//! `s`, and never releases several steps in one message across an event.
//! The hook reads messages only while its game waits before a step, and
//! stops reading once that step is released. Each event is therefore
//! applied exactly between the two steps the room ordered it for, and the
//! [`Gate`] refuses anything that breaks this.
//!
//! This crate has no async runtime and no network code, because the hook
//! links it into the game. [`Session`] is the hook's whole side of the
//! link; the game-specific part of the hook only implements [`Game`].
