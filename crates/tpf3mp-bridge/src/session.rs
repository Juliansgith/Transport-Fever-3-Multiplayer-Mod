//! The game's side of a session, which the hook runs on the game thread.
//!
//! Everything here is game-agnostic. The game-specific part of the hook
//! implements [`Game`] and calls the session from its detours:
//! [`Session::poll_step`] or [`Session::before_step`] before each simulation
//! step, [`Session::after_step`] after it, and [`Session::command`] when the
//! player acts. When the gate says [`StepGate::Load`], the game loads that
//! world and calls [`Session::loaded`].
