//! The hook's and the game's logs, for the server played on (proposed D10
//! amendment): the hook's `hook.log` and the game's `stdout.txt`, tailed
//! from where they stood when the launcher's run began, and the game's
//! error reports (`.txt`, `.json`) in its `crash_dump` folder as they
//! appear. Their lines go into the launcher's [`Recorder`], each tagged
//! with its source, redacted there, and to the server with the launcher's
//! own (`Request::Telemetry`).
//!
//! - **Never** the game's `.dmp` minidumps, which are large and binary,
//!   and never a file whose name looks like a key, certificate or token
//!   ([`crate::logs::looks_secret`]).
//! - **Within budgets.** Each source reads so many bytes a minute
//!   ([`HOOK_PER_MINUTE`], [`GAME_PER_MINUTE`], [`CRASH_PER_MINUTE`]); when
//!   a log grows faster, its oldest unread part is skipped, and the
//!   launcher's log says how much once a minute. A run sends
//!   [`crate::diagnostics::RUN_QUOTA`] bytes at most. Files are read on a
//!   blocking thread of their own, never the game's or a connection's.
//! - **The switch.** "Send diagnostics" Off stops all of it: what was
//!   written meanwhile is passed over, never sent later.
