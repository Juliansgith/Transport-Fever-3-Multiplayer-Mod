//! The TPF3-MP launcher as a native window for Windows, Linux and macOS.
//!
//! The window is drawn with egui ([`app`], in the look of [`theme`], from
//! what [`view`] works out) over the launcher backend of
//! `tpf3mp-agent`, which runs in the same process ([`backend`]). It logs
//! to daily files ([`logs`]) and keeps itself up to date from the
//! project's signed releases ([`update`]). Where no window can be opened,
//! the launcher falls back to the same launcher as a page in the browser,
//! and a window that crashes opens again, or goes to the browser, while the
//! room session runs on ([`window`]).
