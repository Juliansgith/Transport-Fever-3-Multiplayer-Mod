-- tpf3mp/hudguard.lua -- the room's guard in the GUI's other Lua state.
--
-- The game's GUI runs in more than one Lua state (build 40408): the
-- Multiplayer plugin's, where tpf3mp/guard.lua stands in front of
-- api.cmd.sendCommand, and the one the game renders its React recipes in
-- (the HUD's icons, the line manager's depots; gui/tpf3mp/gui_state.script.lua),
-- whose api.cmd is its own. A command a window sends from there went
-- unchecked, and in the room's game ran in this game alone: a hidden desync
-- (docs/COVERAGE.md, "The gates and their holes", U1). This puts the same
-- guard there, with the same rules: a kind the room carries goes to the
-- room, every other is refused.
--
-- One difference: the hook hands what became of the player's actions to one
-- reader (results()), the plugin's state. That state passes on the answers
-- to this state's commands through a note every Lua state shares
-- (hudguard.forward), and this state's guard hears them as the plugin's does
-- (guard.deliver): the store's buy here is answered with the vehicle it
-- bought, which it then puts on its line (2026-10-01: the vehicle store
-- renders here, and refusing its buy blocked buying).
--
-- This state has no frame of its own the mod runs in, so the callbacks the
-- guard defers ("on the next frame") run from tick(), which the state's
-- GUI calls often (each read of the player's company); each waits until the
-- clock moved on twice, so none runs inside the call that sent it.
--
-- Pure Lua; the tests hand it a fake api and link.
