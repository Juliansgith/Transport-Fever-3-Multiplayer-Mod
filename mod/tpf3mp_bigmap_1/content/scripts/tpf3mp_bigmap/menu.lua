-- The New Game page's side of big maps: which rows to add to the size
-- dropdown, and the tiles a picked row and ratio stand for.
--
-- On TPF2 this was native: silver2127's Big Maps (tpf2-bigmap) appended
-- rows to the size dropdown and answered UI::GetNumTilesNew for them,
-- leaving every stock row to the game. TF3's New Game page is a script, so
-- the mod's copy of it (gui/menu/new_game_or_map_settings_page.tl, served
-- by the TPF3-MP hook in place of the game's) does the same with these
-- functions. This file uses no game API apart from reading what the hook
-- left in `resolveutil`: it is plain Lua, tested from
-- crates/tpf3mp-bigmap/tests/mod_lua.rs.
--
-- The rows come from ladder.lua, which is generated from the big-map
-- settings, so the menu offers exactly the sizes those settings can build.
