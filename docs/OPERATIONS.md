# Operations

How to run `tpf3mp-server` on a Linux host, starting with the German server
that already runs `tf2mp-relay`. The deployment mirrors the relay's
hardened container profile.

## What the server needs

- **UDP port 29470** open to the internet: players connect with QUIC.
- **HTTPS on port 443** through the host's reverse proxy, for players whose
  networks block UDP (see [Tunnels](#tunnels)). Optional, but some school,
  office and hotel networks leave no other way.
- **A TLS certificate** for a hostname that points at the server, such as
  `tpf3mp.<ip>.sslip.io`. Agents verify it against public certificate
  authorities, exactly as a browser would.
- **A data volume** holding:
  - `/data/invite.key`: losing it invalidates every invite, including those
    of restored games.
  - `/data/rooms/`: one log per running game, so games survive restarts,
    and a pointer to each game's current snapshot.
  - `/data/rooms/snapshots/`: the world snapshots, deduplicated chunks of
    the games' saves. At most 64 GiB by default (`--snapshot-gib`).

  Back up the key and the logs. Snapshots are rebuilt by the next save, so
  losing them only makes late joiners wait for one.

## First deployment

1. Point a hostname at the server, and open the port:
   `ufw allow 29470/udp`.
2. Get a certificate for that hostname (see [Certificates](#certificates)).
   Place `fullchain.pem` and `privkey.pem` in `deploy/certs/`, readable by
   UID 65532, the image's non-root user:
   ```sh
   sudo chown 65532:65532 deploy/certs/*.pem
   sudo chmod 0440 deploy/certs/*.pem
   ```
3. Build and start the server:
   ```sh
   cd deploy && docker compose up -d --build
   ```
4. Check it from any machine:
   ```sh
   tpf3mp-agent connect tpf3mp.example.org:29470
   ```
   This prints the server version, a session ID and the round trip.

## Certificates

The server reads its certificate at start. After a renewal, restart it:
`docker compose restart`. Two options:

- **certbot.** Use `certbot certonly --standalone -d <host>` while port 80
  is free, or `--webroot` behind the existing reverse proxy. Add a deploy
  hook that copies the renewed files into `deploy/certs/`, fixes their owner
  and restarts the container.
- **Reuse the existing Caddy.** Add the hostname to the Caddyfile so Caddy
  obtains the certificate, then copy it from Caddy's storage
  (`certificates/acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org-directory/<host>/`) with a
  small scheduled job. Caddy's files are root-only, so a copy with the right
  owner is required; do not mount them directly.

For local development, `--dev-self-signed <file>` writes a throwaway
certificate that agents pin with `--pin-cert <file>`.

## Monitoring

- **Metrics.** `http://127.0.0.1:9470/metrics` serves Prometheus text on the
  host: sessions, rooms and tunnels now, plus counters for handshakes
  refused, protocol violations, turns sealed, events ordered, intents
  refused, divergences, slow consumers, log compactions and tunnels opened
  and refused, and for snapshots: saves, snapshots agreed, failed uploads,
  late joins, rebases and bytes served.
- **Alerts.** `deploy/prometheus/tpf3mp.rules.yml` holds alerting rules for
  a Prometheus that scrapes the endpoint: the server down, replicas
  diverging, slow consumers, saves not arriving, handshake floods, protocol
  violations and refused tunnels.
- **Health.** `/healthz` returns `ok`.

## Logs

The server logs to standard output, and Docker keeps the log: at most ten
files of 50 MB each (`logging` in `compose.yaml`), so it never fills the
disk. The log never contains IP addresses or invite tokens.

- **Following it:** `docker compose logs -f`.
- **One player's session.** Every session starts with a line naming its
  support ID (`session=s-…`) and the player (`player=p-…`); the launcher
  shows the player their support ID. `docker compose logs | grep s-3f2a…`
  shows that session; the player ID shows all of that player's sessions,
  and a room ID (`r-…`) the room's life.
- **For a bug report:** `./collect-logs.sh` in `deploy/` writes one
  archive: the log of the last 24 hours (`--since 2h` for another window,
  `--for <ID>` for one session, player or room), the container's state
  (restarts, out of memory), `/healthz`, `/metrics`, and the host's disk and
  memory. It holds no secrets and can be shared.
- **For a log collector** (Loki, Elasticsearch, …): set
  `TPF3MP_LOG_FORMAT: json` in `compose.yaml` (`--log-format json`), for
  one JSON object per line with the same fields.
- **More detail:** `RUST_LOG=debug` adds per-connection refusals;
  `RUST_LOG=tpf3mp_server=debug,quinn=warn` narrows it.

A rise in `divergences_total` means replicas disagree with verdicts: look
at the platforms involved. A rise in `slow_consumers_total` means clients
cannot keep up with their turn streams. `uploads_failed_total` rising
while `snapshots_agreed_total` stands still means players' saves do not
reach the server: late joiners then wait.

## Upgrades

Every player must run the server's protocol version. The handshake tells
players on another version which side to update. To upgrade:

```sh
git pull && cd deploy && docker compose up -d --build
```

What happens during the restart:

1. The old container gets SIGTERM and closes every session with
   `SHUTTING_DOWN`.
2. With `--data-dir` (the image's default), every running game has been
   logged turn by turn. The new server restores those games at start.
3. Players reconnect with the same identity and resume after the last turn
   they applied. The event log continues without a gap. Lobbies that had not
   started are not kept.
4. A restored game that nobody reconnects to within 10 minutes closes and
   its log is deleted, like any running game whose players all disconnected.
   `--abandon-after-mins` sets both: raise it to keep games for players who
   come back another day. Such a game holds its room slot, counted against
   the address that created it, until it closes.

Persistence details:

- **Crash safety.** Each turn is written to the operating system as it is
  sealed, so a process crash loses nothing. A power loss or kernel crash can
  lose the last few turns; a client that saw them is told
  `ResumeUnavailable`, even once the room has sealed new turns with the same
  numbers (see "Histories" in PROTOCOL.md). Logs of an older format are
  set aside, not restored.
- **Damaged logs.** Recovery reads a log without changing it. A damaged final
  record is what a crash leaves behind, so it is cut off once the room is
  rebuilt. Any other damage leaves the log exactly as it was, renamed to
  `*.broken` (or `*.1.broken` and so on, never replacing an earlier one) and
  kept for diagnosis. Symbolic links are ignored.
- **Compaction.** Once a game's log passes 64 MiB (`--compact-log-mib`),
  it is rewritten to start from where the game stands: the canonical
  rules' saved state, plus the last hour of turns for players who resume.
  It is compacted again each time it grows by as much, or by its compacted
  size if that is more. A restart then replays only the turns after the
  rewrite. The new log is written and flushed under
  `<room>.log.compacting` and replaces the old one only when complete, so
  a crash during compaction leaves the old log, and the next start deletes
  the leftover.
- **Size limits.** A log that cannot be compacted, because its rules
  cannot save their state, stops growing at 1 GiB; the game continues but
  would not survive a restart. Each player may send 32 KiB of commands per
  second, with a 256 KiB burst, so an honest game takes days to get there.
  Recovery streams a log and holds at most the last 64 MiB of turns per
  room in memory.
- **Permissions.** On Linux, logs are readable by the server's user only:
  they hold invite and password tags and every command.
- **Invite key.** Restored games are rejoined with their original invites,
  which only verify with the same `invite.key`.
- **Rules.** Each game's log records the rules its host chose. A server that
  no longer offers those rules sets the log aside rather than restoring
  the game with others, so keep offering rules while games use them.
  `native`, the game's own economy, is always offered.

## Tunnels

Some networks let nothing but HTTPS out. Players there reach the server
through a WebSocket tunnel that carries the same QUIC connection, end-to-end
encrypted as always (see "Tunnels" in PROTOCOL.md). Agents try UDP first and,
after 3 s without an answer, also `wss://<server host>/tpf3mp`; whichever
connects first is kept.

The image listens for tunnels on TCP 29471 as plain WebSocket and takes each
player's address from `X-Forwarded-For` (`--tunnel-listen 0.0.0.0:29471
--tunnel-behind-proxy`). The compose file publishes that port on the host's
loopback only, for the reverse proxy that already runs `tf2mp-relay`'s
hostname. Add the TPF3-MP hostname to it:

```caddyfile
tpf3mp.example.org {
    handle /tpf3mp {
        # Overwrite, never trust, the client's own forwarding chain.
        reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:29471 {
            header_up X-Forwarded-For {remote_host}
        }
    }
    handle {
        respond 404
    }
}
```

or with nginx:

```nginx
location = /tpf3mp {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:29471;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
    proxy_read_timeout 120s;
}
```

Without a reverse proxy, the server can serve the tunnel's TLS itself with
its own certificate: `--tunnel-listen 0.0.0.0:443` without
`--tunnel-behind-proxy`. Another path is `--tunnel-path`; players then pass
the whole URL with `--tunnel`.

- **Limits.** Tunnels count against the same per-address limits as UDP
  sessions, by the player's address. At most a session's and a
  handshake's worth of tunnels per address, and as many in total as
  sessions and handshakes together, are open; a player over the share is
  answered `429`. A TLS and WebSocket handshake must finish within 10 s,
  and a tunnel must carry a QUIC connection within 10 s of opening, and
  closes 10 s after its connection ends, so holding one without playing
  gets nowhere. Browsers are refused, so a web page cannot open tunnels
  from its visitors' machines.
- **File descriptors.** Each tunnel is an open connection. The compose
  file raises the container's open-file limit to 65,536; outside Docker,
  raise it for the server's service the same way (`LimitNOFILE=` in a
  systemd unit), or rooms may fail to write their logs under load.
- **Trust.** `--tunnel-behind-proxy` believes the last `X-Forwarded-For`
  entry, and only from a proxy connecting from loopback or a private
  network, where a reverse proxy on the same host or in a container sits.
  `--tunnel-proxy <address or range>`, repeated as needed, narrows that to
  your proxy's own address. Requests without the header are refused.
- **Behind a CDN** the proxy's `{remote_host}` is the CDN's edge, and every
  player would share a few edges' limits. Have the proxy forward the
  CDN's client-address header instead, such as Cloudflare's
  `CF-Connecting-IP`: `header_up X-Forwarded-For {http.request.header.CF-Connecting-IP}`,
  and accept connections only from the CDN's ranges.
- **Metrics.** `tunnels` (open now), `tunnels_opened_total` and
  `tunnels_refused_total`.
- **Players.** `--tunnel <url>` names another tunnel, `--tunnel-only` skips
  UDP, `--no-tunnel` never falls back. The launcher takes the same flags and
  shows "connected via tunnel" when the fallback was needed.

## Snapshots

With `--data-dir`, the server keeps world snapshots in `snapshots/` inside
it (`--snapshot-dir` puts them elsewhere, `--no-snapshots` turns them off).
They let players join a game that has started, rejoin one they can no
longer resume, and repair replicas that diverged. "Snapshots" in
PROTOCOL.md describes the flow.

- **When games save.** Every 10 minutes of play (`--save-every-secs`),
  sooner when a player waits for a world, never twice within a minute
  (`--save-gap-secs`). Every player's game saves at the same step, which
  the players see as a short pause, like an autosave.
- **Traffic.** One player uploads each save; successive saves share most of
  their chunks, so only what changed moves. A player who joins downloads
  the whole world once, then only changes. Up to 32 transfers run at once.
- **Disk.** Each game keeps its current snapshot and the one before; chunks
  both share are stored once. Closed games release theirs, and at start the
  server releases snapshots of games that are gone.

## Big maps

A room waits 20 seconds for a game that stops advancing and 5 minutes for
one loading its world, then plays on and lets that game catch up. Big maps
outgrow both: on TPF2 a big-map save paused the game for 15-20 s and
entering such a world took 4-5 minutes ([BIGMAPS.md](BIGMAPS.md)). For a
server that hosts them, raise both:

```sh
tpf3mp-server ... --stall-timeout-secs 60 --load-timeout-mins 15
```

Longer waits also mean a frozen game holds its room up for longer before
the others play on. Their saves are larger too: a 1.4 GB world must upload
within the 90-minute limit, so at least about 260 KB/s from the player who
uploads it.

## Releases

`.github/workflows/release.yml` builds the player's package for Windows x64,
Linux x64 and macOS arm64: the agent with its launcher, the in-game hook
library and the server, plus a script that opens the launcher.

- **Cutting one.** Every push to `main`, which only receives what passed
  `acceptance` (see [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md)), builds the packages and
  attaches them to a draft release `v<version>`, the version in
  `Cargo.toml`. Review the draft on GitHub, then publish it; publishing
  creates the tag. Later pushes refresh the draft until it is published.
  After that, `main` needs a version bump before it can release again.
- **The server players see first.** Set the repository variable
  `TPF3MP_DEFAULT_SERVER` (Settings, Secrets and variables, Actions,
  Variables) to the public server's `host:port`, and the packages' launcher
  offers it (`--default-server`) until a player has connected elsewhere;
  the launcher remembers each player's last server and name. The packages
  also carry `PLAYING.md`.
- **Building without releasing.** Run the workflow by hand. The packages
  stay workflow artifacts, but the repository is public, so anyone can
  download them.
- **Until the game is out** the hook finds no build profile and installs
  nothing, so the package is for trying the launcher and the netcode with
  the fake game.

## Capacity

Measured with `tpf3mp-loadtest` on one Windows desktop, with the server and
400 bot clients in the same process:

- 50 rooms of 8 players;
- 1,000 steps at 50 steps per second;
- 229,000 events applied across replicas;
- no divergence;
- p99 command latency 114 ms on loopback, through the socket that also
  takes tunnels, as deployed;
- with every bot in a TLS tunnel instead (`--tunneled`): p99 116 ms and
  the same run time. On loopback nothing is lost, so this measures the
  tunnel's own cost; on a lossy link, TCP holds datagrams back behind each
  lost segment;
- one full room of 64 players: p99 116 ms, no divergence;
- with every room logged and compacted past 8 KiB (`--data-dir`,
  `--compact-log-kib 8`), 3,000 steps: 121 compactions during the run,
  p99 114 ms, and memory level at about 150 MB.

The server on its own, as a separate release-build process with the bots in
another, 1,500 steps at 50 steps per second:

| rooms × players | logged | server CPU | memory | p99 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 100 × 4 | no | 0.38 cores | 31 MB | 112 ms |
| 200 × 4 | yes | 0.70 cores | 48 MB | 114 ms |

That is about a three-hundredth of a core per busy room, growing linearly,
with logging costing little. Rooms default to 5 steps per second, far
fewer turns than this.

Memory follows the rooms: 20 rooms of 4 players took a server at 13 MB at
rest to 33 MB after 5 minutes of play, as each room's resume window fills
(it holds up to an hour of turns). Once the games closed, it settled at
19 MB and stayed there; 15 minutes of play in one process showed no
divergence and steady latency.

Repeat against the real host after deploying. Every bot connects from the
machine running the load test, so first raise that address's limits on the
server, for example with `--max-sessions-per-address 1000
--max-handshakes-per-address 1000`, and restore them afterwards:

```sh
cargo run --release -p tpf3mp-testkit --bin tpf3mp-loadtest -- \
    --server tpf3mp.example.org:29470 --rooms 20 --bots 8 --paced
```

`--paced` makes the bots play at the room's pace behind a jitter buffer, as
games do, so the latencies it reports are the ones players would feel.
`--tunnel wss://tpf3mp.example.org/tpf3mp` sends every bot through the
tunnel instead, through the reverse proxy.

## Security notes

- The container runs as a non-root user with a read-only root filesystem,
  every Linux capability dropped, `no-new-privileges`, and limits on PIDs,
  memory and CPU. It mounts only its certificates (read-only) and its own
  data volume.
- The admin endpoint has no authentication. The compose file publishes it
  on the host's loopback only.
- One network address holds at most 8 sessions and 4 handshakes in progress
  (`--max-sessions-per-address`, `--max-handshakes-per-address`). An IPv6
  /64 counts as one address. A household or LAN party with more players
  behind one address needs a higher limit.
- Once half of the 256 handshake slots are busy, new clients must prove
  their address with a QUIC retry, so spoofed packets cost nothing. The
  `retries_sent` and `connections_refused` counters show when this happens.
- A session that stays outside any room for 10 minutes is closed
  (`idle_sessions_closed`).
- One address has at most 8 open rooms (`--max-rooms-per-address`). A room
  counts until it closes, and a running game with nobody connected closes
  after 10 minutes (`rooms_abandoned`). Throwaway identities therefore
  cannot fill the server's rooms.
- Rotate the invite key only deliberately: every existing invite stops
  working.
